<hr />

A source generator for C# that uses Roslyn to create extensions and parsers for enumerations, allowing to get a value associated to enum member or parse back from attribute value to enum member. All code generated at compile time thus avoid using reflection or boilerplate code.

## Compatibility

Raiqub.Generators.RaiqubToolkit runs with Roslyn compiler so does not introduce a new dependency to your project besides a library containing the EnumGenerator attribute.

It requires at least the .NET 6 SDK to run, but you can target earlier frameworks.
